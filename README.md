# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a coding exercise. It is a command-line game of Tic-Tac-Toe which
supports both human and computer players. The game has been programmed so
that the computer player cannot be beaten. Of course, should you succeed
at defeating the program without editing it, get in touch --- I have a reward
for you.

### Running Tic-Tac-Toe

To run the program, clone the repository and compile the source files with the
command:
```
make
```
Then you can run the game with:
```
make run
```
When you are done, clean it all up with:
```
make clean
```
